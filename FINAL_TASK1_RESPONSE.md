## 📋 FOR YOUR TEAM MEMBER (TASK 2 - Traditional Methods)

### What They Need to Know:

**Dear Task 2 Team Member,**

I've completed the AI-powered analysis (Task 1). Here's what you need to do:

#### Your Mission:
Analyze the **exact same data** using **traditional methods only**:
- ❌ No AI tools (no Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
- ✅ Excel formulas and pivot tables
- ✅ Manual calculations
- ✅ Standard charts/graphs
- ✅ PowerPoint for dashboard assembly

#### Data Files to Analyze:
- `patients.csv` (974 records)
- `encounters.csv` (27,891 records)
- `procedures.csv` (47,701 records)
- `organizations.csv` (1 record)
- `payers.csv` (10 records)

#### You Must Calculate:
1. **All demographic statistics** (age, gender, race, etc.)
2. **All financial metrics** (revenue, costs, coverage, etc.)
3. **All clinical metrics** (procedures, durations, encounters)
4. **All temporal patterns** (yearly, monthly, weekly, hourly)
5. **All risk analyses** (high utilizers, high cost patients)

#### You Must Create:
1. **Demographics Dashboard** (4 charts)
2. **Financial Dashboard** (6 charts)
3. **Clinical Dashboard** (4 charts)
4. **Temporal Dashboard** (4 charts)
5. **Risk Dashboard** (4 charts)

#### Validation:
Use my results to check if your numbers are correct:
- Check `ai_analysis_insights.json`
- Compare against all dashboards
- Your numbers should match mine (±5%)

#### Documentation Required:
1. **Excel workbook** with all calculations
2. **PowerPoint** with all dashboards
3. **TASK2_TRADITIONAL_ANALYSIS_DOCUMENTATION.md** file
4. **Time log** (how long each task took)
5. **Comparison notes** (what was easier/harder)

#### Reference Documents:
- **`TASK1_AI_ANALYSIS_DOCUMENTATION.md`** - See expected results
- **All dashboard images** - Visual comparison targets
- **`ai_analysis_insights.json`** - Validate your calculations

**Estimated Time Needed:** 12-16 hours (vs my 3.5 hours with AI)
